# Analyzer for Computer Numerical Control Machines

Analyzer is used to detect errors on CNC machines, so users can quickly find the cause or error. In background, it creates failure tree analysis, so it can provide users with action plans or other solutions.

As of now, this is only a testing application, in the beta stage.
