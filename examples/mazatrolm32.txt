Here's an example of a Mazak Mazatrol M32 A program that uses M-codes:

Copy code
PROG1;
G00 G40 G80 G90;
M06 T01;
M08;
G00 X50. Y30. Z5.;
G01 Z-5. F100.;
G00 Z5.;
M09;
M30;
In this example, the program starts with the program name "PROG1" and then sets some basic G-codes like G00 (rapid positioning), G40 (cutter compensation cancel), G80 (cancel canned cycle), and G90 (absolute programming).

The program then uses the M06 command to request a tool change to tool number 1 (T01), followed by the M08 command to turn on coolant.

Next, the program uses G00 to move the tool to position X50, Y30, Z5. and then uses G01 to move the tool down to position Z-5 at a feed rate of 100 units per minute. After completing the cut, the program uses G00 to move the tool back up to position Z5.

Finally, the program turns off the coolant with the M09 command and ends the program with the M30 command.


Here's an example of a G-code program in EIA/ISO format:

This program includes some comments in parentheses and starts with a percent sign, indicating that it is a program in EIA/ISO format. The program contains a number of G-codes and M-codes, which specify various operations to be performed on a CNC machine.



The Mazak Mazatrol M32 A control uses a proprietary programming language called Mazatrol, which is used to control the movements of the machine tools. The Mazatrol language is similar to a conversational programming language and is designed to be easy to use for operators who are not experienced in traditional CNC programming languages.

Here is an example of a simple Mazatrol program that would move the tool to a specific position and then perform a drilling operation:

This program starts with the percent sign, which tells the control that a new program is beginning. The O0001 is the program number, and the next line is a brief description of the program.

The program then sets the start position by selecting the coordinate system G54 and moving the tool to X100, Y100, and Z100.

The tool is then changed, and the control moves the tool to a specific position for drilling. The G83 command initiates the drilling cycle, with Z-25 indicating the depth of the hole, R2 indicating the retract distance, and F100 indicating the feed rate.

After the drilling operation is complete, the control returns to the initial position and the program ends with the percent sign.
